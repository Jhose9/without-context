# Pending Fixes

## Window Reload Issue

Currently, the application uses `window.location.reload()` in several places to handle state updates that require a page refresh. This is a temporary solution that needs to be improved.

### Current Implementation

The reload is being used when:

- Starting a new game to reset the game state
- Ensuring all components have the latest game data

### Why This Needs To Be Fixed

Using `window.location.reload()` is not an optimal solution because:

- It creates a poor user experience with visible page refreshes
- It doesn't follow React's state management best practices
- It can lead to unnecessary server requests
- It may cause the loss of application state

### Proposed Solutions

1. Implement proper state management using:

   - React's useState and useEffect hooks more effectively
   - A state management library if needed (Redux, Zustand, etc.)
   - Context API for global state updates

2. Create a proper game reset function that:
   - Clears necessary state values
   - Reinitializes game components
   - Updates localStorage without requiring a page refresh

### Priority

This should be addressed as a high-priority improvement to enhance user experience and follow React best practices.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
